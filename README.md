# ðŸ“Š Analytics Engineer

Welcome to the **Analytics Engineer** repository! This project focuses on the transfer and modeling of data from OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems to OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems. It serves as a base for ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) processes, enabling efficient data analysis and reporting.

## Introduction

In today's data-driven world, effective data management is crucial. This repository provides a framework for transferring and modeling data between OLTP and OLAP systems. It is designed for analytics engineers who want to streamline their data workflows and improve data accessibility.

### Why OLTP to OLAP?

- **OLTP** systems handle day-to-day operations, focusing on transaction processing.
- **OLAP** systems support complex queries and data analysis, enabling better decision-making.

By transferring data from OLTP to OLAP, organizations can gain insights from their transactional data.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several key directories:

```
AnalyticsEngineer/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ eltscripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ raw/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ processed/
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/
â””â”€â”€ tests/
```

- **src/**: Contains source code for ELT scripts and data models.
- **data/**: Holds raw and processed data files.
- **notebooks/**: Includes Jupyter notebooks for data analysis.
- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for code validation.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes various technologies to achieve its goals:

- **MySQL**: For OLTP database management.
- **Oracle**: For OLAP data storage and processing.
- **Python**: For scripting and data manipulation.
- **SQL**: For querying databases.
- **Kimball Methodology**: For dimensional modeling in data warehousing.

### Key Topics

- **Analytics**: The process of analyzing data to gain insights.
- **Data Modeling**: Structuring data for efficient analysis.
- **ELT**: Extracting data, loading it into a destination, and transforming it as needed.
- **Engineering**: Building robust data pipelines.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smoothDakan/AnalyticsEngineer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change to the project directory:

   cd AnalyticsEngineer
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**

   Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Database Setup**

   Set up your MySQL and Oracle databases according to the configuration files provided in the `src/` directory.

5. **Download and Execute Releases**

   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/smoothDakan/AnalyticsEngineer/releases) to download the latest release. Follow the instructions provided there to execute the necessary scripts.

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can start using the scripts provided in the `src/` directory. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how to run the ELT scripts:

1. **Extract Data**

   Run the extraction script to pull data from your OLTP system:

   ```bash
   python src/eltscripts/extract.py
   ```

2. **Load Data**

   Load the extracted data into your OLAP system:

   ```bash
   python src/eltscripts/load.py
   ```

3. **Transform Data**

   Transform the data to fit your analysis needs:

   ```bash
   python src/eltscripts/transform.py
   ```

4. **Run Analysis**

   Open a Jupyter notebook from the `notebooks/` directory to perform data analysis using the loaded data.
